              <h4>Avoid Bankruptcy and Get Out of Debt the Easy Way with a Consumer Proposal</h4>
              <p>At Debt.ca, we understand that people might find themselves surrounded with debt for many reasons including job loss, reduced income, medical expenses, or even the rising costs of raising a family. And when faced with a mountain of consumer debt, it is quite easy to become overwhelmed and to believe that you will never be able to pay off your creditors. The high interest rates associated with consumer debts, late fees for those who are behind on their payments, and much more can seem to conspire against your attempts to become debt free. That is why we want to help all Canadians better understand their debt relief options and save the most money while they get out from under their unsecured loans.</p>
              <p>Are you struggling with debt or trying to figure out which Canadian debt relief program will help you get out of debt in the quickest amount of time and for the least amount of money? If so, let us show you that you can live a life free of bills and you do have more options than you probably realize. Simply put, if your paying out more money every month than you have coming in, we can get you to a professional who can help. Fill out the form above to get started today!</p>

Please verify all settlement estimates, fees and other program information directly with a debt specialist from your product vendor or service provider.</p>
              <p>Debt.ca reserves the right to modify these Terms of Use from time to time without notice. You agree to review the terms regularly, and your continued access or use of the Site will mean that you agree to any changes.

              <h3>PRODUCTS AND SERVICES</h3>
              <p>You understand and agree that Debt.ca is not a service provider and is not the creditor for or issuer of the products or services featured on the Site. Any products or services advertised at this Site or made available to you after you receive a financial product from an issuer are by and remain the sole responsibility of the respective product vendors and service providers. Debt.ca does not assume or pay any debt, nor does it provide legal advice or offer credit repair services. If you require legal advice, you will need to consult with a licensed attorney. Individual results are highly dependent on successful completion of program and your ability to save money. Settlement estimates of 40 – 60% are examples of past performance and are not intended to be a guarantee of future settlement results. Results will vary based on individual circumstances.
